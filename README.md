# Arduino-Remote-Control
Arduino based implementation with 2 sensors including an Ultrasonic and an alcohol sensor, controlled by an IR-receiver.

1. There is also some code in brackets as comments which applies for the LCD display. Personally I did not attached it but it should work properly if so.

2. This code is written in C, in the Arduiono IDE.
